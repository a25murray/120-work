# Week 4- Creative Coding

  During my work over the last week I learned a lot. Once again, the course website was really laid out nicely and really helped me complete the assignment this week. Listed below are the takeaways I had while completing the homework this week:

  1. Understand how to draw in p5.js by using the following functions:
    - arc()
    - translate()
    - rotate()
    - scale()
    - push()
    - pop()
  2. Understand the order of operations in which the above functions should be coded into the program.
  3. Understand how color works in this package and how customizable it is and how using color can make your program unique.

I took many steps while creating this assignment. First I downloaded the example from the website and look at the contents that were in that folder.

Secondly, I renamed the folder to HW4 and got to work creating functions to set up a canvas to display the background my drawing was going to be displayed on. I then translated the canvas to 300,300 to center my canvas. Translating the canvas makes everything easier down the road when you are trying to create shapes because it makes it simpler to map out what you want to do. I then started to create my drawing, starting with the head and working my way down. This was a very time consuming process.

Lastly, I committed my repo to Github.com and used the index.html to create a  [viewable](https://a25murray.github.io/120-work/HW4/) webpage that runs my program.

## Issues

  I am glad that I started this assignment early. This assignment was very time consuming because it was difficult to make everything line up. I could not for the life of me get my title at the bottom to be straight. It is slightly tilted which I could not figure out how to make it straight.

  Since I am still new at this, I do not feel like I have the understanding to help other students yet.
