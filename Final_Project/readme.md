##Final Project overview

This project really challenged me in ways I did not to expect. I knew that I would have to learn how to load images, but I learned a lot more than that. I learned how to set up a local server with node.js to do so. Playing around with images was fun but frustrating. It took me a long time but once I got the background loaded, I created an array of stars. I had to use Photoshop to change the size of them or it didnâ€™t look right. I than created a separate .js file to create a function to be called in my original file. I also tried to incorporate sound. For some reason, when I tried to use the sound.play() function, my sketch would not load. I tried to loop it and I even tried to open the sketch in many different web browsers, but it did not work. In my final project I used many coding techniques that I learned over the course of the semester. I used the following techniques:
  -	Loops
  -	Functions
  -	Preload
  -	Arrays
  -	Push and Pop
  -	And a lot of math!!
When I created another .js file I had to change my index.html file. I added this line of code:
  - <script src="sketch0.js"></script>
This line of code allowed for my sketch to use the function I created inside it. I liked the final project because It challenged me to incorporate a lot of different techniques and it challenged me to be really organized when coding. I changed my idea of what I wanted the project to look like multiple times. I like how it turned out in the end. I look forward to using p5 more in the future, thanks for the great semester!
