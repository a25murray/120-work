##Creative Coding Final Project Proposal

#Project Idea:

Looking over the course website this week I found it cool that you can incorporate images into your sketch. For my final project I was thinking about making a sketch that incorporates music and an image that I can use for the background. I really liked the firefly example on the final project page of the course website. I will be suing that as a baseline for my project. For my project I am thinking of creating a pitch-black night sky with a moon and maybe some mountain ridgelines. I will then use small circles that glow to be the stars. I am also thinking of putting an image of a shooting star that will follow the mouse around the screen. Finally, I will put a song in the background or maybe a soothing night time sound like crickets. Because I graduate this semester I wanted to create something that will remind me of a summer night in Montana.

#Struggles:

Because this is my first semester using p5, I have only begun to use the tools that I have learned in the class, so I know this project will take me a long time. I have never done anything with images or sound, so I will have to research about how to incorporate those ideas into my sketch. If done correctly I know that I will be able to make something very special and cool with the information I have learned over the course of the semester.

#Work Plan:

My work plan will be as follows:
-	Upload an image of my choice as the background
- Create the glowing stars to populate the sky
-	Upload an image to be a shooting star that follows my mouse around the screen
-	Add sound (no idea how to do this)

So far I have only set up a folder to be my final project, its time to get going!
