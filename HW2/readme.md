2. What steps did you take to complete the assignment?

3. Did you have any problems or issues?
```
  - How did you solve these?
  - Did you post about these to the class repo issue tracker?
  - Did you receive any useful feedback from your classmates?
```
4. Is there anything in particular you learned that you would like to discuss further?

5. What issues did you help your fellow classmates out with this past homework cycle?
# Homework 2
1. Following the details form the website I was able to download GitHub Desktop and Atom. Once I finished downloading those apps I then started to play around with the IDE and commits I then created a readme file under the HW 2 folder.

2. I followed the steps the professor told us on his website. After creating the folders like said in the instructions I was able to create this file that you are reading right now and publish it to the cloud through GitHub Desktop.

3. I did not run into many problems during this assignment. The only problem I had was that Atom would not open through GitHub Desktop.
```
  - I opened the command line and use the command atom -f
  - I did not post the issue to the class repo issue tracker yet.
  - I have not received any feedback.
```
4. I really liked the **text2.md** that was given as an example. That file really helped me create the format that this page is in.

5. There was no issues in HW 1.
