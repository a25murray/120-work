# HW 11 | OOP
This week I felt added a lot of dimensions to coding. OOP is a great way to do complex things. I really relied on the example and the course website to get me going this week. Trying to understand the constructor was difficult for me but I think I have a pretty good idea of what its doing. This week I created a sky with a sun in it, if you scroll the mouse wheel up or down, clouds will be created that move ever so slightly. I am looking forward to next week and the final project, which will put everything together.
