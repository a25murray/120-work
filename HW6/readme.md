# Week 6- Creative Coding

  During my work over the last week I learned how big of a role math plays into Coding. The videos on the website really helped get the ideas down this week. Listed below are the takeaways I had while completing the homework this week:

  1. Understand how animation in p5.js related to math by using the following fundamentals:
    - console.log()
    - The map function(map())
    - Random Number Generators  
    - Strings
    - JavaScript Objects
  2. Understand how the fundamentals above can be used to create an algorithm artwork piece.

I took many steps while creating this assignment. First I downloaded the example from the website and look at the contents that were in that folder.

Secondly, I renamed the folder to HW6 and got to work creating functions and global variables to set up a canvas to display the background my drawing was going to be displayed on. I then set my desired framerate to 20. After everything was set up, I used the constrain() function to limit the growth of the circle I wanted to display. I then used some math and populated the screen with random circles. After that I used the map() function to create a circle that would grow based on where my mouse was on the page. Here is a [viewable](https://a25murray.github.io/120-work/HW6/) webpage that runs my program.

## Last weeks Issues

  *I am glad that I started this assignment early. This assignment was very time consuming because it was difficult to make everything make sense in my head. I wanted to implement a function that would clear the canvas and start over but I could not figure that out. Since I could not figure that out, the only way to restart the animation is to refresh the page.* (Last weeks issue)

  ## Resolved ^

  I resolved the issue I had from last week. If you create a mousePressed() function, you are able to clear the page and restart the animation.

  ## Issues
  This week I did not run into many issue, I just really had to think in my head how all the working parts were going to relate.
