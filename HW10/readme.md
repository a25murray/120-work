# HW 8 | Functions
This week I learned how to use arrays. Arrays really help you keep your code clean and concise. I also learned how powerful functions are and why they are necessary to create programs and art. I could not get my second function to work so I will have to look at that later. I feel comfortable with arrays but I will need to spend more time with functions. I did not help any other students this week because there was a lot of content to take in and I feel like I didn't not have the experience to help out. I look forward to the up coming weeks and the final project should be fun when we get to combine all that we've learned over the semester.
