# HW 8 | Loops
 This week I followed through the material that was on the course website. This week was not very challenging for me because most of the stuff was review. As for the stuff that was not review, the examples on the website helped me understand the concepts that were presented. I am starting to realize how powerful coding is when used to create art. Although I am far from being great I find myself feeling confident in the short skillset that I have acquired. I look forward to the rest of the semester!
