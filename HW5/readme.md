# Week 5- Creative Coding

  During my work over the last week I learned a lot. Once again, the course website was really laid out nicely and really helped me complete the assignment this week. Listed below are the takeaways I had while completing the homework this week:

  1. Understand the basics of animation in p5.js by using the following functions/ variables:
    - frameRate()
    - rotate()
    - mouseX and mouseY
    - frameCount
    - random
  2. Understand the order of operations in which the above functions should be coded into the program and what Variable Scope is and how important that is to the success of the output.
  3. Learn how math is necessary in animation and can really transform your visuals into something pretty cool .

I took many steps while creating this assignment. First I downloaded the example from the website and look at the contents that were in that folder.

Secondly, I renamed the folder to HW5 and got to work creating functions to set up a canvas to display the background my drawing was going to be displayed on. I then set my desired framerate to 20. After everything was set up, I started to create a triangle that would be redrawn in the screen over and over again based on the framerate. Lastly I created a growing circle that would follow my mouse's location on the canvas. Lastly, I committed my repo to Github.com and used the index.html to create a [viewable](https://a25murray.github.io/120-work/HW5/) webpage that runs my program.

## Issues

  I am glad that I started this assignment early. This assignment was very time consuming because it was difficult to make everything make sense in my head. I wanted to implement a function that would clear the canvas and start over but I could not figure that out. Since I could not figure that out, the only way to restart the animation is to refresh the page.

  This week I did respond to a question that was posted to Github.com. I helped a student that had asked what the weekly readme should look like.
